Installation and run instructions:

UPGMA.jar file is an executable file which should be run from the terminal via command: 

sudo java -jar UPGMA.jar [argument1] [argument2]

It is important when running UPGMA.jar that your working directory is "Bioinformatika" because of folder hierarchy.

Also important is running UPGMA.jar with sudo privileges because of the executable file njplot.linux used for ploting the phylogeny tree in Newick format.
If njplot is already installed this is not important.

Currently implemented models of DNA evolution: argument1 == 1 (JUKES CANTOR)
